# Automatic_BakemyScan
Project entirely based on the wonderful work of Loic Norgeot here https://github.com/norgeotloic/BakeMyScan. 

I just turned it into an independant plugin you can launch through a batch script. 

Basically, just create a folder named after your object, in the input folder. In your object folder, be sure to name your object and your texture exactly like the name of the folder. Then you just drag and drop the folder containing your object on the Automatic_Bake.bat, and it will decimate and bake and export 4 different versions of the decimated model, all in GLB, in the Output folder.

For more info about how to use this plugin, please refer to https://docs.minsar.app/howtos/bakemyscan/
