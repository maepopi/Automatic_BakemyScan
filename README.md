# Automatic_BakemyScan
Project entirely based on the wonderful work of Loic Norgeot here https://github.com/norgeotloic/BakeMyScan. 

I just turned it into an independant plugin you can launch through a batch script. Basically you just drag and drop the folder containing your object on the script, and it will decimate and bake and export 4 different versions of the decimated model, all in GLB. 

For more info about how to use this plugin, please refer to [USERGUIDE LINK]
